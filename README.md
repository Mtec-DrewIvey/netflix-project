Netflix Replica Project

Using TailwindCSS, create a static webpage. I chose to do a Netflix Login page. 

TailwindCSS was a great tool and made the project quick and efficient and once I had the base page completed I was able to go back and add things like hover states to buttons. I also added a Modal to the page when a user clicks on the 'Sign In' button in the top right. The Modal would be used to sign in an existing user. There is very basic validation to confirm the email/password fields are not blank, but does not have any more complex logic to check for password lenght, valid email etc... 

Developer's Thoughts
Overall I found both Bootstrap and Tailwind to be fantastic resources for building quick webpages. My biggest issue with both is the number of classes I find adding to the html starts to get pretty long. Especially when wanting to add hover states that need to do multiple things or when adding responsiveness and adding breakpoint classes. I also think it may become easy to rely on these frameworks and then I might have a hard time going back to base CSS/SCSS.
